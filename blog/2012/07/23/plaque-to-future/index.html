<div class="entry-content"><p>So what now for the plaque? Again, Glenn Miller:</p>

<blockquote><p>As to the plaque’s condition, you will note from the photo that it is weathered and in need of restoration. In addition, a medallion on the left side of the plaque is missing.</p>

<p>As to the plaque’s future, that is very much up for discussion. Our association certainly feels a special kinship to it, to the important Newbery history that it memorializes, and to the hard work and vision of PaLA members from the 1970s who spearheaded this effort. We also recognize that there is genuine interest in this on the part of some of John Newbery’s descendants. And we are mindful of the serendipitous nature of the plaque’s disappearance and discovery.</p>

<p>I should point out that while PaLA has managed to survive this recession, we are not an association blessed with vast resources. Our membership totals about 1600 and we operate with a small staff of four people. Our top priority in Pennsylvania continues to be the advancement of literacy through library services of all types—public, academic, school and special. But I should also note that PaLA has always placed high importance on sustaining and expanding library services for children, a commitment that I imagine John Newbery would applaud.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the plaque as it is now:</p>

<p style="text-align:center;"><a href="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9067036/plaquehole/NewberyPlaqueAtPaLAJuly162012.jpg"><img src="https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/9067036/plaquehole/thumbs/NewberyPlaqueAtPaLAJuly162012.jpg" alt="Newbery Plaque At PaLA July 16 2012" /></a></p>

<p>(note the brown table. This isn&rsquo;t a black and white image - the plaque has become completely discoloured through mistreatment and weathering)</p>

<p>Claire Watts has looked into a replacement for the plaque:</p>

<blockquote><p>We have done some research and have discovered we can apply for an official blue plaque to replace the missing one. It is by no means a given that we will be granted one but I think John Newbery would have a good case. The criteria are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>There must be reasonable grounds for believing the subject is eminent or deserving</li>
<li>The subject has made important positive contribution to history or society</li>
<li>They shall be outstanding personalities that a passer by will recognise.</li>
<li>There is a cost of one thousand pounds mentioned but if he is considered worthy enough I think they will erect the plaque regardless.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The website for official City of London plaques is here: <a href="http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/bluePlaques/">http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/bluePlaques/</a></p>

<p>So what next for the plaque? My initial instinct is that the plaque should now remain where it is in Mechanicsburg - PaLA&rsquo;s obvious dedication in funding the plaque in the first place and in rescuing it from a garden in Hounslow make me think that it has now found its home. I&rsquo;ve asked Glenn whether there are metalworkers in Pennsylvania who can restore the plaque:</p>

<blockquote><p>I have not yet investigated restoration but I am sure that there are skilled craftspeople around who can tackle it. My wife and I live in Lancaster about an hour away [from Mechanicsburg] and there are lots of skilled artisans in our region. But I have no real idea on cost. It may be more extensive than I think. The missing medallion is one aspect and, cosmetically, oxidation would need to be removed. But as I examine it more closely, the top edge bulges in two distinctive spots. I can only imagine that demolition workers and/or thieves might have used a crow bar to dislodge it from the wall. I suppose that this could be re-forged into a straighter edge—purely speculation on my part. Ironically, the photo on your blog may be one of the best images we have of the missing medallion.</p></blockquote>

<p>Perhaps, as Claire has suggested, we can fund a replacement blue plaque for the site of John Newbery&rsquo;s shop near St. Paul&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>So now, I turn to the floor. What do people think about restoring the original plaque? Or about funding a replacement? Perhaps we could use <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">kickstarter</a> or a similar service to raise any necessary funds. As Glenn says above, the future of the plaque is still up for discussion.</p>
