<div class="entry-content"><p>I sent my first petition to Boris Johnson, mayor of London on Tuesday 23rd March. Below is the full text, as well as photos of yours truly standing beside the original plaque.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Mr Johnson,</p>

<p>I write to you as a fellow citizen of London, a lover of this city&rsquo;s great tradition and heritage, and, like you, a devotee of  the written word. I refer, of course, to your oeuvre of fictional and  non-fictional works which have delighted so many and added so much to  the intellectual life of this nation. Your wit and erudition have  provided your many readers with hours of pleasure and entertainment.</p>

<p>I wish in no way to denigrate your achievements when I point out that we are lucky to live in a time and in a nation that prizes literature so highly; a nation in which the one of the wealthiest women has earned her fortune through the writing of children&rsquo;s books; a nation where our literary giants are feted like rock stars; a nation which publishes more books annually than any other country in the world. We are all fortunate to live in a society where literature is woven so closely into our cultural life, and where writers of every genre are celebrated and are able to find an audience.</p>

<p>It is sometimes useful to remind ourselves that this has not always been the case: that the process of writing and publishing has not always been as easy as it is in our time, and that the authors of today are in a very real sense standing on the shoulders of the giants that came before: authors and publishers who have built this nation&rsquo;s great literary industry.</p>

<p>Many years ago, before I lived in London, I came to the city to carry out a period of work experience at St. Bart&rsquo;s Hospital. Whilst staying here I went on a pilgrimage to the site of my ancestor&rsquo;s house from which he ran his book-selling business. His name was John Newbery, and although no longer a household name in this country, he was one of the most pivotal figures in the history of  publishing in England, and indeed the entire English-speaking world. He is quite properly honoured and commemorated in the United States, by having his name attached to the premier prize for children&rsquo;s literature in that nation, the John Newbery Medal.</p>

<p>For although he would be remembered as a great man had he simply been the publisher of Samuel Johnson, Oliver Goldsmith and Christopher Smart, it is in the field of children&rsquo;s literature that John Newbery is most remembered. Prior to his work, children&rsquo;s writing was not a recognised literary genre. Children&rsquo;s stories had of course been written before, and had been included in various other publications, but never before had whole books been published explicitly for children, and never before had children&rsquo;s stories been published in such great numbers. John Newbery&rsquo;s publication of &lsquo;A Little Pretty Pocket Book&rsquo;, &lsquo;The History of Little Goody Two Shoes&rsquo; and &lsquo;Mother Goose&rsquo;s Melody&rsquo; literally (please excuse the pun) created a new industry, and it isn&rsquo;t too much of a stretch to call him the Father of English Children&rsquo;s Literature.</p>

<p>When I arrived at St Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard, the site of John Newbery&rsquo;s business, I was delighted to find a plaque dedicated to his memory erected by the Pennsylvania Library Association. I attach to this email two photographs: one of the plaque, and one of your humble petitioner, aged 15, next to it. I have recently revisited the site and was dismayed to discover that the plaque was removed during renovation of the area.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether the plaque has simply been moved to a new location or destroyed, but I implore you to look into this serious matter. There are fewer cities greater than London, and fewer that strive so boldly into a new and exciting future. We must  ensure that in this pursuit of the new, we do not forget that of which we should be most proud: our shared heritage.</p>

<p>I trust that you will look into this matter for me, and I look forward to your response,</p>

<p>Yours faithfully,</p>

<p>John Newbery</p></blockquote>
