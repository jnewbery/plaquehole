  <div class="entry-content"><p>So what now for the plaque? Again, Glenn Miller:</p>

<blockquote><p>As to the plaque’s condition, you will note from the photo that it is weathered and in need of restoration. In addition, a medallion on the left side of the plaque is missing.</p>

<p>As to the plaque’s future, that is very much up for discussion. Our association certainly feels a special kinship to it, to the important Newbery history that it memorializes, and to the hard work and vision of PaLA members from the 1970s who spearheaded this effort. We also recognize that there is genuine interest in this on the part of some of John Newbery’s descendants. And we are mindful of the serendipitous nature of the plaque’s disappearance and discovery.</p>

<p>I should point out that while PaLA has managed to survive this recession, we are not an association blessed with vast resources. Our membership totals about 1600 and we operate with a small staff of four people. Our top priority in Pennsylvania continues to be the advancement of literacy through library services of all types—public, academic, school and special. But I should also note that PaLA has always placed high importance on sustaining and expanding library services for children, a commitment that I imagine John Newbery would applaud.</p></blockquote>

<p>Here&rsquo;s the plaque as it is now:</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dIXj1ELr0gw/UAxrFtydNHI/AAAAAAAABDc/CGiyCDcHsUA/s1600/Newbery+plaque+at+PaLA+July+16+2012.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="240" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-dIXj1ELr0gw/UAxrFtydNHI/AAAAAAAABDc/CGiyCDcHsUA/s320/Newbery+plaque+at+PaLA+July+16+2012.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>


<p>(note the brown table. This isn&rsquo;t a black and white image - the plaque has become completely discoloured through mistreatment and weathering)</p>

<p>Claire Watts has looked into a replacement for the plaque:</p>

<blockquote><p>We have done some research and have discovered we can apply for an official blue plaque to replace the missing one. It is by no means a given that we will be granted one but I think John Newbery would have a good case. The criteria are as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>There must be reasonable grounds for believing the subject is eminent or deserving</li>
<li>The subject has made important positive contribution to history or society</li>
<li>They shall be outstanding personalities that a passer by will recognise.</li>
<li>There is a cost of one thousand pounds mentioned but if he is considered worthy enough I think they will erect the plaque regardless.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>

<p>The website for official City of London plaques is here: <a href="http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/bluePlaques/">http://www.cityoflondon.gov.uk/bluePlaques/</a></p>

<p>So what next for the plaque? My initial instinct is that the plaque should now remain where it is in Mechanicsburg - PaLA&rsquo;s obvious dedication in funding the plaque in the first place and in rescuing it from a garden in Hounslow make me think that it has now found its home. I&rsquo;ve asked Glenn whether there are metalworkers in Pennsylvania who can restore the plaque:</p>

<blockquote><p>I have not yet investigated restoration but I am sure that there are skilled craftspeople around who can tackle it. My wife and I live in Lancaster about an hour away [from Mechanicsburg] and there are lots of skilled artisans in our region. But I have no real idea on cost. It may be more extensive than I think. The missing medallion is one aspect and, cosmetically, oxidation would need to be removed. But as I examine it more closely, the top edge bulges in two distinctive spots. I can only imagine that demolition workers and/or thieves might have used a crow bar to dislodge it from the wall. I suppose that this could be re-forged into a straighter edge—purely speculation on my part. Ironically, the photo on your blog may be one of the best images we have of the missing medallion.</p></blockquote>

<p>Perhaps, as Claire has suggested, we can fund a replacement blue plaque for the site of John Newbery&rsquo;s shop near St. Paul&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>So now, I turn to the floor. What do people think about restoring the original plaque? Or about funding a replacement? Perhaps we could use <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/">kickstarter</a> or a similar service to raise any necessary funds. As Glenn says above, the future of the plaque is still up for discussion.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>So what happened to the Plaque next? The story is best taken up by Glenn Miller again. He&rsquo;s kindly allowed me to reproduce an article he wrote for the January/February/March 2011 issue of the PaLA bulletin:</p>

<blockquote><h3>The Case of the Missing Plaque</h3>

<h4>BY GLENN R. MILLER</h4>

<p>Yes, it may seem like the title to a Nancy Drew mystery, but this story is real. And perhaps the final chapter is yet to be written.<br />It began in the late 1970s when a group of highly motivated PaLA members started to explore a way to commemorate the life of renowned 18th century children&rsquo;s publisher and book seller John Newbery. The effort was spearheaded by PaLA members Joan Pressler and Angela Ivanovic, Pittsburgh area librarians whose interest in Newbery led them to officials in London, who helped them pinpoint the location of Newbery&rsquo;s business near St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral. This was no small task considering that the area was destroyed by bombing during World War II.</p>

<p>The PaLA group decided that a bronze plaque at the location of Newbery&rsquo;s business would be a fitting tribute, and fundraising efforts began. This Newbery Memorial Committee continued to work with officials in London, whose blessing for the project was needed. On January 21, 1978, the city gave its final approval for the placement of the plaque adjacent to the north courtyard of St. Paul&rsquo;s.</p>

<p>In July of that year, a delegation of PaLA members, led by Pressler, Ivanovic, and PaLA executive secretary Nancy Blundon, traveled to London for the plaque&rsquo;s dedication. At 2 p.m. on July 24, 1978, the formal unveiling ceremony took place at Number 65, St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard. Godfrey Thompson, the librarian of the City of London, accepted the plaque on behalf of the Guildhall Reference Library and the City of London Council. To our knowledge, this was the only plaque ever erected at the site where Newbery, the &ldquo;father of children&rsquo;s literature&rdquo;, printed and sold books and became so instrumental in advancing children&rsquo;s literacy.</p>

<p>For more than two decades, the plaque stood for all to see. Quite by accident in 1997, I stumbled upon it during a trip yo London. The next year, PaLA member Pat Dixon saw and photographed the plaque, and her story appeared in te November/December 1998 issue of the PaLA Bulletin. In the story, Dixon raised a concern about the plaque since she was told that the building to which it was attached was scheduled to be demolished.</p>

<p>What happened next is not entirely clear. We know that the building was, in fact, demolished, and the plaque disappeared. PaLA was not aware of this until 2008.</p>

<p>Enter Andrew Fulkner, a conscientious Londoner with a curious mind. He and his wife Julie, daughter Francesca, and son Alexander moved into a new townhouse apartment not far from Heathrow Airport. The new apartment was in dire need of cleaning and repair due to the precious tenants who showed little interest in maintaining the property and experienced numerous brushes with the law. The backyard was a mess, too, overgrown and strewn with rubbish, some of it partially burned. Andrew, a lovel of history and a bit of a genealogist, and Julie a teacher&rsquo;s assistant agreed to take the apartment because they needed the extra space and the backyard offered great potential.</p>

<p>As the Fulkers were cleaning up their new backyard, they discovered something large and heavy buried in their garden with just one corner exposed above ground. After a few minutes of digging, they uncovered PaLA&rsquo;s plaque commemorating John Newbery. They knew this was not your run-of-the-mill garden discovery. It&rsquo;s not every day that a bronze plaque weighing nearly 50 pounds appears out of the earth.</p>

<p>To their everlasting credit, the Fulkers realized that what they had in their possession was something more valuable than a lawn ornament. A memorial of this size and weight must mean something to someone. Andrew did some searching and soon discovered ALA&rsquo;s Association for Library Services for Children (ALSC). The ALSC executive director, in turn, led him to PaLA. We confirmed that the plaque, indeed, came from PaLA and that it had stood for more than two decades at Number 65, St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard. How the plaque got from that spot to its burial plot in east suburban London may never be known.</p>

<p>This past November, my wife and I travelled to London to visit our daughter who was studying abroad for the semester. In advance, I contacted Andrew Fulker and we agreed to meet. I took the Underground to the Hounslow stop where Andrew picked me up and drove me to his home where I met Julie, Francesca, and Alexander. They showed me the Newbery plaque that they had cleaned up and brought indoors fro its usual display place on a bench in their back yard. We talked and shared some tea and speculated how the plaque might have come to its garden resting spot.</p>

<p>The Fulkers graciously agreed to allow the plaque to return to PaLA and, in return, PaLA offered a modest reward to the Fulers in appreciation for their honesty, conscientiousness, and kindness throughout the entire process. And in the spirit of going that extra mile, Andrew took pity on me and drove me back to my London hotel, an hour away, so that I did not have to lug the 50-pound plaque on the Tube.</p>

<p>The next day,the hotel concierge helped to arrange for shipping the plaque back to the U.S. It arrived at PaLA&rsquo;s Mechanicsburg headquarters on November 2010. In December, the plaque was transported to PaLA&rsquo;s Leadership Orientation in Bedford, where it was unveiled to PaLA&rsquo;s 2010-2011 leaders. I shared the full story with the group.</p>

<p>And here&rsquo;s one more wrinkle. Our third vice president, Carrie Turner, did some digging and discovered that a descendent of John Newbery has launched an effort to find out what happened to the Newbery plaque near St. Paul&rsquo;s. He saw it some years ago and is aware of its disappearance.I expect to reach out to him now that the plaque is in hand and a new year is underway.</p>

<p>In all likelihood, the mystery of how the plaque disappeared will remain a mystery. But fate has delivered it back into PaLA&rsquo;s hands and the final chapter in the Newbery Memorial plaque saga may yet be written.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>And there the plaque stood for about two decades, in a passageway besides St. Paul&rsquo;s Cathedral. I visited on a weekday evening in 2000, and the majority of people passing were city workers, rushing home from a day trading stocks or inventing derivatives. I wonder how many slowed down long enough to even notice the plaque.</p>

<p>The next mention we have of the plaque is from 1998, again in the Pennsylvania Library Association Newsletter:</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-86wriIiYgHo/UAxVqt4t5RI/AAAAAAAABC8/nZrQenJLXuU/s1600/1998Update.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-86wriIiYgHo/UAxVqt4t5RI/AAAAAAAABC8/nZrQenJLXuU/s320/1998Update.jpg" width="170" /></a></div>


<p>Pat Dixon writes that the building that the plaque is attached to is marked for demolition, and wonders about the plaque&rsquo;s eventual fate. Two years later, the building and plaque are still there. I visit with my mother, and have a (slightly awkward) photo taken in front of the plaque:</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-i9-R4ATp3sg/S6kfaUhS4CI/AAAAAAAAAA0/RIUVAuwoiVg/s1600/John_Newbery_plaque.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="230" src="http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-i9-R4ATp3sg/S6kfaUhS4CI/AAAAAAAAAA0/RIUVAuwoiVg/s320/John_Newbery_plaque.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>

<p>I visit the site again in 2010, and the plaque is gone. And that&rsquo;s where this blog all started.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Glenn&rsquo;s unexpected message had been prompted by an email from a lady named Claire Watts.</p>

<blockquote><p>May I introduce myself. I am a member of the Newbery family and a descendant of the children’s publisher.</p></blockquote>

<p>A hitherto unknown cousin and, what&rsquo;s more, the representative of the family at the unveiling of the plaque. She&rsquo;d also noticed the absence of the plaque.</p>

<blockquote><p>In July 1978 a plaque was erected on the wall of St Paul’s Churchyard in London by the Pennsylvania Library Association.</p>

<p>It has come to the attention of some Newbery family members that the plaque you erected has been removed.</p>

<p>We have done some research with the City of London Surveyors office and they have no official record of its existence and no idea where it might now be. That area of St Paul’s Churchyard has been redeveloped over recent years.</p></blockquote>

<p>Claire goes on to ask whether the Association know of the plaque&rsquo;s whereabouts, and whether they feel that it should be replaced. She also attaches the original order of service from the unveiling in 1978.</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GkS2nA6oslI/UAbTjutACxI/AAAAAAAABBc/TRgGzwADGZc/s1600/1978OrderOfService.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="231" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-GkS2nA6oslI/UAbTjutACxI/AAAAAAAABBc/TRgGzwADGZc/s320/1978OrderOfService.jpg" width="320" /></a></div>


<p>The plaque had been funded by individual donations of $1 or more from the members of the Pennsylvania Library Association. The total cost of the plaque was $1000 (about $3,500 in today&rsquo;s money) so this was an extremely generous gift from PaLA.</p>

<p>Glenn also included in his email various documents from the period. First is a fundraising letter for the plaque:</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kau3lGT-e3o/UAxJ2-es3bI/AAAAAAAABCQ/oH9EJbuPbPI/s1600/FundraisingLetter.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-kau3lGT-e3o/UAxJ2-es3bI/AAAAAAAABCQ/oH9EJbuPbPI/s320/FundraisingLetter.jpg" width="245" /></a></div>


<p>The full text of the letter:</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Member:</p>

<p>Plans are progressing rapidly for the John Newbery Memorial Plaque to be installed in St. Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard, City of London, on July 10, 1978. Approval of the proposal package submitted by the PLA committee was granted January 21, 1978, by the Planning and Communications Committee, Court of Common Council, City of London; we are now asking that you become personally involved.</p>

<p>Would you please contribute one dollar ($1.00) toward the plaque cost and installation? Would you take a moment or two and mail it to association headquarters? The Board of Directors of the Pennsylvania Library Association has given permission for the committee to make this request, with the stipulation that any funds received after all the expenses for the memorial have been paid must be given to the PLA Scholarship Fund.</p>

<p>Thank you for your contribution. Your cooperation in the special, and unusual, project is appreciated. Please send your check, made payable to the Pennsylvania Library Association, and the bottom portion of this letter to the following address:</p>

<p>Nancy Blundon, Executive Secretary<br/>
<strong>PENNSYLVANIA LIBRARY ASSOCIATION</strong><br/>
100 Woodland Road<br/>
Pittsburgh, PA. 15232</p></blockquote>

<p>Also included were two cuttings from the PaLA newsletter. (The name of the newsletter is the PLA bulletin - The acronym for the Pennsylvania Library Association was officially changed from PLA to PaLA in the early 1990s due to the PLA namespace becoming rather crowded, not least by the Public Library Association, a national organisation here in America.)</p>

<p>The first cutting is from March 1978, and sets out the plans for a tour of England, Scotland and Wales, during which the plaque would be unveiled:</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EZ75v9IacSY/UAxJ5ca1caI/AAAAAAAABCg/ouqxQB7xVhA/s1600/PaLABulletin1.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://1.bp.blogspot.com/-EZ75v9IacSY/UAxJ5ca1caI/AAAAAAAABCg/ouqxQB7xVhA/s320/PaLABulletin1.jpg" width="245" /></a></div>


<p>The second is from October 1978, reporting on the unveiling of the plaque</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oDqOs3I0sY8/UAxJ6UfypqI/AAAAAAAABCo/QyJvtdkqv0s/s1600/PaLABulletin2.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-oDqOs3I0sY8/UAxJ6UfypqI/AAAAAAAABCo/QyJvtdkqv0s/s320/PaLABulletin2.jpg" width="245" /></a></div>


<p>And finally there&rsquo;s a cutting from a newspaper reporting on the unveiling of the plaque. Unfortunately, neither the date nor the name of the publication are visible, and a google search for the text doesn&rsquo;t turn up any results. I assume this is a Pennsylvania publication from the headline - perhaps the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette or Pittsburgh Press, since the PLA was at the time based in that city. The text of the article shows that it must have been published between July 8th and 23rd 1978.</p>

<div class="separator" style="clear: both; text-align: center;"><a href="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Bc-ohtk3q1Q/UAxJ4IHR1DI/AAAAAAAABCY/X_dmMEgoinw/s1600/NewspaperArticle.jpg" imageanchor="1" style="margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;"><img border="0" height="320" src="http://2.bp.blogspot.com/-Bc-ohtk3q1Q/UAxJ4IHR1DI/AAAAAAAABCY/X_dmMEgoinw/s320/NewspaperArticle.jpg" width="135" /></a></div>


<p>The full text:</p>

<blockquote><p><em>State Librarians Cite English Literary Figure</em></p>

<p>A group of Pennsylvania librarians will honor John Newbery, the &ldquo;father of children&rsquo;s literature,&rdquo; with a dedication of a plaque at the site of his shop in St. Paul&rsquo;s churchyard, London, later this month.</p>

<p>John Pressler of Chatham Center and Angela Ivanovic of Monroeville will present the bronze plaque to the City of London and head librarian of the Guildhall Library, at a ceremony July 24.</p>

<p>The librarians are members of the John Newbery Memorial Committee of the Children&rsquo;s, Young People&rsquo;s and School Librarians' division, Pennsylvania Library Association.</p>

<p>An 18th century printer and book seller, Newbery published such children&rsquo;s classics as &ldquo;Miss Goody Two Shoes,&rdquo; &ldquo;Mother Goose Melodies&rdquo; and the &ldquo;Lilliputian Magazine,&rdquo; the first periodical for Children.</p>

<p>He is best known in America for the Newbery medal, an annual award presented by the American Library Association to an American author of an outstanding book for children.</p>

<p>Newbery was also published of Oliver Goldsmith and a patron of Samuel Johnson, Tobias Small [&hellip;]</p>

<p><em>this section of the article is cut off from the image.</em></p>

<p>[&hellip;] who was always in a hurry. The author once called him &ldquo;the honestest man in the nation.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Miss Pressler, who has studied Newbery and his work for a number of years, worked closely with Thompson in pinpointing the exact location of the bookshop. The task was especially difficult because the area was leveled by Nazi bombs during World War II.</p>

<p>They used ancient maps and documents to confirm the site in the middle of the old walled City of London which dates back to the time of the Roman Conquest.</p>

<p>The plaque, which cost $1,000, is being paid for by $1 contributions from members of the state library association.</p>

<p>Miss Pressler and Miss Ivanovic will leave Wednesday to take the plaque to London. There, they will join more than 20 state librarians who have been touring Britain since July 7. The dedication will cap their visits to various historical sites in literature in that country.</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Progress! This morning I received an email from Glenn Miller, executive director of the Pennsylvania Library Association:</p>

<blockquote><p>Hi, John. I&rsquo;m the executive director of the Pennsylvania Library Association. I have some good news and an update for you on the missing Newbery plaque. It is a long story. If you would, please touch base with me via email</p></blockquote>

<p>I was quite frankly astonished that anyone had come across my blog, and especially that the someone was legendary jazz musician Glenn Miller, apparently back after a 70 year absence. I was quickly disabused of that notion:</p>

<blockquote><p>no, I am no relation (unfortunately) to the great band leader, Glenn Miller, who disappeared over the English Channel in 1944</p></blockquote>

<p>I have to admit that I wasn&rsquo;t expecting to hear anything further regarding the plaque, having started this blog with tongue somewhat in cheek and subsequently neglected it for two years. I emailed him back within twenty minutes, and half an hour later Glenn had provided the full story.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I have replied to Chrenkin&rsquo;s fine email. Hopefully his endeavours are continuing apace, and will bear fruit presently. If not, I&rsquo;m going to have to step up the campaign and get some celebrity endorsements. Anybody ever met J K Rowling?</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Mr Jenkins,</p>

<p>Most sincere thanks for your kind words. As you say, how unfortunate that the plaque has been misplaced, but how wonderful that your opinions on this matter are the same as mine. I wish you the best of luck in your endeavours!</p>

<p>As for myself, I will of course continue to make enquiries into the whereabouts of the plaque. Please keep me updated on any progress you make - I will do likewise.</p>

<p>Could you please supply me with your office email address so I can address my future emails directly to you.</p>

<p>Warm regards,</p>

<p>John Newbery</p></blockquote>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Good news for everyone who loves plaques! The mantle has been taken up by Chris Jenkins, of the Culture Team in City Hall. I couldn&rsquo;t possible phrase it better than the esteemed Mr. Jenkins, so I reproduce here, verbatim, his words on the subject:</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Mr Newbery</p>

<p>Thank you for your email, addressed to the Mayor, which has been passed to me for a response.</p>

<p>Thank you for outlining the situation, and how unfortunate that the plaque has been moved.  As you state this was in the vicinity of St > Paul&rsquo;s it would be a logical starting point to ascertain if it has been put into storage while works were being undertaken.</p>

<p>I will endeavour to make some enquiries about this, and it may help if you were also willing to pursue as well.</p>

<p>Yours sincerely</p>

<p>Chris Jenkins
Culture Team</p></blockquote>

<p>By Jove, if Mr. Jenkins hasn&rsquo;t just cut to the very crux of the matter with laser-like precision. Truly a man after my own heart. I shall be responding in due course, and in the interim urge you all to wish the man luck in his endeavours to enquire.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I sent my first petition to Boris Johnson, mayor of London on Tuesday 23rd March. Below is the full text, as well as photos of yours truly standing beside the original plaque.</p>

<blockquote><p>Dear Mr Johnson,</p>

<p>I write to you as a fellow citizen of London, a lover of this city&rsquo;s great tradition and heritage, and, like you, a devotee of  the written word. I refer, of course, to your oeuvre of fictional and  non-fictional works which have delighted so many and added so much to  the intellectual life of this nation. Your wit and erudition have  provided your many readers with hours of pleasure and entertainment.</p>

<p>I wish in no way to denigrate your achievements when I point out that we are lucky to live in a time and in a nation that prizes literature so highly; a nation in which the one of the wealthiest women has earned her fortune through the writing of children&rsquo;s books; a nation where our literary giants are feted like rock stars; a nation which publishes more books annually than any other country in the world. We are all fortunate to live in a society where literature is woven so closely into our cultural life, and where writers of every genre are celebrated and are able to find an audience.</p>

<p>It is sometimes useful to remind ourselves that this has not always been the case: that the process of writing and publishing has not always been as easy as it is in our time, and that the authors of today are in a very real sense standing on the shoulders of the giants that came before: authors and publishers who have built this nation&rsquo;s great literary industry.</p>

<p>Many years ago, before I lived in London, I came to the city to carry out a period of work experience at St. Bart&rsquo;s Hospital. Whilst staying here I went on a pilgrimage to the site of my ancestor&rsquo;s house from which he ran his book-selling business. His name was John Newbery, and although no longer a household name in this country, he was one of the most pivotal figures in the history of  publishing in England, and indeed the entire English-speaking world. He is quite properly honoured and commemorated in the United States, by having his name attached to the premier prize for children&rsquo;s literature in that nation, the John Newbery Medal.</p>

<p>For although he would be remembered as a great man had he simply been the publisher of Samuel Johnson, Oliver Goldsmith and Christopher Smart, it is in the field of children&rsquo;s literature that John Newbery is most remembered. Prior to his work, children&rsquo;s writing was not a recognised literary genre. Children&rsquo;s stories had of course been written before, and had been included in various other publications, but never before had whole books been published explicitly for children, and never before had children&rsquo;s stories been published in such great numbers. John Newbery&rsquo;s publication of &lsquo;A Little Pretty Pocket Book&rsquo;, &lsquo;The History of Little Goody Two Shoes&rsquo; and &lsquo;Mother Goose&rsquo;s Melody&rsquo; literally (please excuse the pun) created a new industry, and it isn&rsquo;t too much of a stretch to call him the Father of English Children&rsquo;s Literature.</p>

<p>When I arrived at St Paul&rsquo;s Churchyard, the site of John Newbery&rsquo;s business, I was delighted to find a plaque dedicated to his memory erected by the Pennsylvania Library Association. I attach to this email two photographs: one of the plaque, and one of your humble petitioner, aged 15, next to it. I have recently revisited the site and was dismayed to discover that the plaque was removed during renovation of the area.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t know whether the plaque has simply been moved to a new location or destroyed, but I implore you to look into this serious matter. There are fewer cities greater than London, and fewer that strive so boldly into a new and exciting future. We must  ensure that in this pursuit of the new, we do not forget that of which we should be most proud: our shared heritage.</p>

<p>I trust that you will look into this matter for me, and I look forward to your response,</p>

<p>Yours faithfully,</p>

<p>John Newbery</p></blockquote>
