Glenn's unexpected message had been prompted by an email from a lady named Claire Watts.

> May I introduce myself. I am a member of the Newbery family and a descendant of the children’s publisher.

A hitherto unknown cousin and, what's more, the representative of the family at the unveiling of the plaque. She'd also noticed the absence of the plaque.

> In July 1978 a plaque was erected on the wall of St Paul’s Churchyard in London by the Pennsylvania Library Association. 
>
> It has come to the attention of some Newbery family members that the plaque you erected has been removed. 
>
> We have done some research with the City of London Surveyors office and they have no official record of its existence and no idea where it might now be. That area of St Paul’s Churchyard has been redeveloped over recent years.

Claire goes on to ask whether the Association know of the plaque's whereabouts, and whether they feel that it should be replaced. She also attaches the original order of service from the unveiling in 1978.

The plaque had been funded by individual donations of $1 or more from the members of the Pennsylvania Library Association. The total cost of the plaque was $1000 (about $3,500 in today's money) so this was an extremely generous gift from PaLA. 

Glenn also included in his email various documents from the period. First is a fundraising letter for the plaque:

The full text of the letter:

> Dear Member: 
>
> Plans are progressing rapidly for the John Newbery Memorial Plaque to be installed in St. Paul's Churchyard, City of London, on July 10, 1978. Approval of the proposal package submitted by the PLA committee was granted January 21, 1978, by the Planning and Communications Committee, Court of Common Council, City of London; we are now asking that you become personally involved. 
>
> Would you please contribute one dollar ($1.00) toward the plaque cost and installation? Would you take a moment or two and mail it to association headquarters? The Board of Directors of the Pennsylvania Library Association has given permission for the committee to make this request, with the stipulation that any funds received after all the expenses for the memorial have been paid must be given to the PLA Scholarship Fund. 
>
> Thank you for your contribution. Your cooperation in the special, and unusual, project is appreciated. Please send your check, made payable to the Pennsylvania Library Association, and the bottom portion of this letter to the following address: 
>
> Nancy Blundon, Executive Secretary  
> **PENNSYLVANIA LIBRARY ASSOCIATION**  
> 100 Woodland Road  
> Pittsburgh, PA. 15232

Also included were two cuttings from the PaLA newsletter. (The name of the newsletter is the PLA bulletin - The acronym for the Pennsylvania Library Association was officially changed from PLA to PaLA in the early 1990s due to the PLA namespace becoming rather crowded, not least by the Public Library Association, a national organisation here in America.)

The first cutting is from March 1978, and sets out the plans for a tour of England, Scotland and Wales, during which the plaque would be unveiled:

The second is from October 1978, reporting on the unveiling of the plaque 

->[![PaLA Bulletin 2]({{ site.images_thumbs }}/PaLABulletin2.jpg)]({{ site.images }}/PaLABulletin2.jpg)<-

And finally there's a cutting from a newspaper reporting on the unveiling of the plaque. Unfortunately, neither the date nor the name of the publication are visible, and a google search for the text doesn't turn up any results. I assume this is a Pennsylvania publication from the headline - perhaps the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette or Pittsburgh Press, since the PLA was at the time based in that city. The text of the article shows that it must have been published between July 8th and 23rd 1978.

The full text: 

> *State Librarians Cite English Literary Figure*
>
> A group of Pennsylvania librarians will honor John Newbery, the "father of children's literature," with a dedication of a plaque at the site of his shop in St. Paul's churchyard, London, later this month. 
>
> John Pressler of Chatham Center and Angela Ivanovic of Monroeville will present the bronze plaque to the City of London and head librarian of the Guildhall Library, at a ceremony July 24. 
>
> The librarians are members of the John Newbery Memorial Committee of the Children's, Young People's and School Librarians' division, Pennsylvania Library Association. 
>
> An 18th century printer and book seller, Newbery published such children's classics as "Miss Goody Two Shoes," "Mother Goose Melodies" and the "Lilliputian Magazine," the first periodical for Children. 
>
> He is best known in America for the Newbery medal, an annual award presented by the American Library Association to an American author of an outstanding book for children. 
>
> Newbery was also published of Oliver Goldsmith and a patron of Samuel Johnson, Tobias Small [...] 
>
> *this section of the article is cut off from the image.*
>
> [...] who was always in a hurry. The author once called him "the honestest man in the nation." 
>
> Miss Pressler, who has studied Newbery and his work for a number of years, worked closely with Thompson in pinpointing the exact location of the bookshop. The task was especially difficult because the area was leveled by Nazi bombs during World War II. 
>
> They used ancient maps and documents to confirm the site in the middle of the old walled City of London which dates back to the time of the Roman Conquest. 
>
> The plaque, which cost $1,000, is being paid for by $1 contributions from members of the state library association. 
>
> Miss Pressler and Miss Ivanovic will leave Wednesday to take the plaque to London. There, they will join more than 20 state librarians who have been touring Britain since July 7. The dedication will cap their visits to various historical sites in literature in that country.
