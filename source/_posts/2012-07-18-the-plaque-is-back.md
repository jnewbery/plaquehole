Progress! This morning I received an email from Glenn Miller, executive director of the Pennsylvania Library Association:

> Hi, John. I'm the executive director of the Pennsylvania Library Association. I have some good news and an update for you on the missing Newbery plaque. It is a long story. If you would, please touch base with me via email

I was quite frankly astonished that anyone had come across my blog, and especially that the someone was legendary jazz musician Glenn Miller, apparently back after a 70 year absence. I was quickly disabused of that notion:

> no, I am no relation (unfortunately) to the great band leader, Glenn Miller, who disappeared over the English Channel in 1944

I have to admit that I wasn't expecting to hear anything further regarding the plaque, having started this blog with tongue somewhat in cheek and subsequently neglected it for two years. I emailed him back within twenty minutes, and half an hour later Glenn had provided the full story.
