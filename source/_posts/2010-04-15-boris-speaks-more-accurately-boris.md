Good news for everyone who loves plaques! The mantle has been taken up by Chris Jenkins, of the Culture Team in City Hall. I couldn't possible phrase it better than the esteemed Mr. Jenkins, so I reproduce here, verbatim, his words on the subject:

> Dear Mr Newbery
> 
> Thank you for your email, addressed to the Mayor, which has been passed to me for a response.
> 
> Thank you for outlining the situation, and how unfortunate that the plaque has been moved.  As you state this was in the vicinity of St > Paul's it would be a logical starting point to ascertain if it has been put into storage while works were being undertaken.
> 
> I will endeavour to make some enquiries about this, and it may help if you were also willing to pursue as well.
> 
> Yours sincerely
> 
> Chris Jenkins
> Culture Team

By Jove, if Mr. Jenkins hasn't just cut to the very crux of the matter with laser-like precision. Truly a man after my own heart. I shall be responding in due course, and in the interim urge you all to wish the man luck in his endeavours to enquire.
