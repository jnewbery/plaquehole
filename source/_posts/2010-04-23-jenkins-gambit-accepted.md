I have replied to Chrenkin's fine email. Hopefully his endeavours are continuing apace, and will bear fruit presently. If not, I'm going to have to step up the campaign and get some celebrity endorsements. Anybody ever met J K Rowling?

> As for myself, I will of course continue to make enquiries into the whereabouts of the plaque. Please keep me updated on any progress you make - I will do likewise.
>
> Could you please supply me with your office email address so I can address my future emails directly to you.
