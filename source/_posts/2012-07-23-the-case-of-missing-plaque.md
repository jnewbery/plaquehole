So what happened to the Plaque next? The story is best taken up by Glenn Miller again. He's kindly allowed me to reproduce an article he wrote for the January/February/March 2011 issue of the PaLA bulletin:

> ### The Case of the Missing Plaque

> #### BY GLENN R. MILLER

> Yes, it may seem like the title to a Nancy Drew mystery, but this story is real. And perhaps the final chapter is yet to be written.<br />It began in the late 1970s when a group of highly motivated PaLA members started to explore a way to commemorate the life of renowned 18th century children's publisher and book seller John Newbery. The effort was spearheaded by PaLA members Joan Pressler and Angela Ivanovic, Pittsburgh area librarians whose interest in Newbery led them to officials in London, who helped them pinpoint the location of Newbery's business near St. Paul's Cathedral. This was no small task considering that the area was destroyed by bombing during World War II.

> The PaLA group decided that a bronze plaque at the location of Newbery's business would be a fitting tribute, and fundraising efforts began. This Newbery Memorial Committee continued to work with officials in London, whose blessing for the project was needed. On January 21, 1978, the city gave its final approval for the placement of the plaque adjacent to the north courtyard of St. Paul's.
>
> In July of that year, a delegation of PaLA members, led by Pressler, Ivanovic, and PaLA executive secretary Nancy Blundon, traveled to London for the plaque's dedication. At 2 p.m. on July 24, 1978, the formal unveiling ceremony took place at Number 65, St. Paul's Churchyard. Godfrey Thompson, the librarian of the City of London, accepted the plaque on behalf of the Guildhall Reference Library and the City of London Council. To our knowledge, this was the only plaque ever erected at the site where Newbery, the "father of children's literature", printed and sold books and became so instrumental in advancing children's literacy.
>
> For more than two decades, the plaque stood for all to see. Quite by accident in 1997, I stumbled upon it during a trip yo London. The next year, PaLA member Pat Dixon saw and photographed the plaque, and her story appeared in te November/December 1998 issue of the PaLA Bulletin. In the story, Dixon raised a concern about the plaque since she was told that the building to which it was attached was scheduled to be demolished.
>
> What happened next is not entirely clear. We know that the building was, in fact, demolished, and the plaque disappeared. PaLA was not aware of this until 2008.
>
> Enter Andrew Fulkner, a conscientious Londoner with a curious mind. He and his wife Julie, daughter Francesca, and son Alexander moved into a new townhouse apartment not far from Heathrow Airport. The new apartment was in dire need of cleaning and repair due to the precious tenants who showed little interest in maintaining the property and experienced numerous brushes with the law. The backyard was a mess, too, overgrown and strewn with rubbish, some of it partially burned. Andrew, a lovel of history and a bit of a genealogist, and Julie a teacher's assistant agreed to take the apartment because they needed the extra space and the backyard offered great potential.
>
> As the Fulkers were cleaning up their new backyard, they discovered something large and heavy buried in their garden with just one corner exposed above ground. After a few minutes of digging, they uncovered PaLA's plaque commemorating John Newbery. They knew this was not your run-of-the-mill garden discovery. It's not every day that a bronze plaque weighing nearly 50 pounds appears out of the earth.
>
> To their everlasting credit, the Fulkers realized that what they had in their possession was something more valuable than a lawn ornament. A memorial of this size and weight must mean something to someone. Andrew did some searching and soon discovered ALA's Association for Library Services for Children (ALSC). The ALSC executive director, in turn, led him to PaLA. We confirmed that the plaque, indeed, came from PaLA and that it had stood for more than two decades at Number 65, St. Paul's Churchyard. How the plaque got from that spot to its burial plot in east suburban London may never be known.
>
> This past November, my wife and I travelled to London to visit our daughter who was studying abroad for the semester. In advance, I contacted Andrew Fulker and we agreed to meet. I took the Underground to the Hounslow stop where Andrew picked me up and drove me to his home where I met Julie, Francesca, and Alexander. They showed me the Newbery plaque that they had cleaned up and brought indoors fro its usual display place on a bench in their back yard. We talked and shared some tea and speculated how the plaque might have come to its garden resting spot.
>
> The Fulkers graciously agreed to allow the plaque to return to PaLA and, in return, PaLA offered a modest reward to the Fulers in appreciation for their honesty, conscientiousness, and kindness throughout the entire process. And in the spirit of going that extra mile, Andrew took pity on me and drove me back to my London hotel, an hour away, so that I did not have to lug the 50-pound plaque on the Tube.
>
> The next day,the hotel concierge helped to arrange for shipping the plaque back to the U.S. It arrived at PaLA's Mechanicsburg headquarters on November 2010. In December, the plaque was transported to PaLA's Leadership Orientation in Bedford, where it was unveiled to PaLA's 2010-2011 leaders. I shared the full story with the group.
>
> And here's one more wrinkle. Our third vice president, Carrie Turner, did some digging and discovered that a descendent of John Newbery has launched an effort to find out what happened to the Newbery plaque near St. Paul's. He saw it some years ago and is aware of its disappearance.I expect to reach out to him now that the plaque is in hand and a new year is underway.
>
> In all likelihood, the mystery of how the plaque disappeared will remain a mystery. But fate has delivered it back into PaLA's hands and the final chapter in the Newbery Memorial plaque saga may yet be written.
