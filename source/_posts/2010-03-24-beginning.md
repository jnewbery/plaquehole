I've started this blog to record my mission to find the plaque of my ancestor, [John Newbery](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Newbery), which was scandalously removed from St. Pauls Cathedral Churchyard in London during redevelopment of the area.

Thanks to everyone who has supported me in my quest. Please check back often to find out what the latest developments are.
